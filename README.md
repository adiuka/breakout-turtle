# Breakout - Turtle based game

A simple breakout style game programmed in Python's turtle module. Must admit it is not perfect, coordinate recognition can be a bit jittery sometimes but works quite okay.
Used multiple techniques I found online to generate something that works. Includes continuous movement upon holding down keys.

The next steps for improvement are:
1. Create Ball Powerups, that make the ball and gameplay more exciting.
2. Create a UI, that allows you to pause and start the game
3. Create a different bounce off of specific blocks
4. Create more variation of bounce angles
5. Integrate mouse movement

Otherwise enjoy!
